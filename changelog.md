### Major Additions and Changes 
* Electrum & Adamant Reworks (See Below)
- New Intrinsic/Effect Icons! (They look awesome, 💻/🖌️, Voxybuns)
- Wither Effect is **VERY** nasty now (Easy mode is exempt)
    * Shakudo Chestplate no longer cleanses wither
    * Please bring milk or bread to Hell, please its very important
    * Wither skeleton feet stabbies won't work anymore, but you should try to do it anyways ;)
- Crystal hearts are now "used" instead of "forced" on players, since the new death system provides enough incentive
    * They also double as cheap totems (at max hearts), and great healing items when < max health, so have fun with them
### Tweaks & Small Additions 
- Enderman can only pick up melon, pumpkins, and TNT (💻, Linkershim)
- Multiplayer support improvements! (💻, Linkershim)
- Trim Colours added
    * Yet to add: Electrum, Shakudo, Hepatizon, Silver
    * If you have better textures send them to the github, I ran out of ideas for these
- Buffed Sturdy Leather's Safe Fall Distance (1 -> 2)
- Sturdy Leather can now be repaired with tattered leather
- Sturdy Leather Boots now have a step height intrinsic (👥)
- Feather Falling is better now (base damage reduction 12% -> 24%; max damage reduction 48% -> 72%)
- Heart Decrementing is now only local not global (Per player not per world, I made this imagining a small group of friends playing together. Not large servers, this change was made to help with that, difficulty is still set at 5 hearts, but since this can be changed I dont think its a big issue)
- Opal Earrings now only give Conduit Power when in water (quick patch job probably needs optimisation)
- Zephyr enchantment reworked so that its 3 levels (👥💻, freshdoktor)
- Elegy of the Abbey and Crete updated to their new versions
- Bulk Dirt added to Mason Trade
- Bulk Blocks now have distinct models
- Diamond, Amethyst, and Lapis Earrings (They don't do anything but they ARE very cute) (👥)
- Emeralds are not found in deepdarks (sculk covers most of them, so why not?) (👥)
- Hard mode husks are slightly slower (But still faster than normal mode) (👥)
- Lily pads can now be cloned (👥)
- Chains can now be climbed
- Taiga Grass colour slightly changed to be a little less ugly
- Mobs spawned from spawners no longer drop anything (💻, HapppySpud)
- Withers can now only be spawned on the surface of the overworld




#### Cooking Changes & Additions 

#### Electrum & Warding
- Netherite and Electrum count for piglin-safe armours (👥, CHECK WHO SUGGESTED THIS)
- Electrum Equipment can no longer burn in lava or fire (since its technically netherite now)
- Warding now "Stacks" with others of its same "type" (that sounds confusing, let me explain)
    * If you hold a ✟ 1 item in your mainhand, and a ✟ 2 in your off-hand, it will apply a ✟ 3 level effect
    * This cannot exceed ✟ 3 without electrum armour, ✟ 4 is reserved for the electrum set bonus effect
    * ✟ 4 has other benefits, it can slow husks and even pierce copper armour's warding resistance
    * **Wearing** **✟** 1 and **holding** ✟ 1 will not create a ✟ 2 effect, ✟ always prefers to check armour over held items.
    * So If you hold a ✟ 3 and are wearing **✟** 2, it will have a ✟ 3 effect. If you are wearing **✟** 3 and holding ✟ 2, will will have a ✟ 3 effect
    * Some minor things have been changed, like the particle effect working on babies, unique particles for slowness v damage, and the way warding works, no longer constant, instead running on a timer
    * ✟ 1 & 2 - effect/1s
    * ✟ 3 & 4 - effect/0.5s
- Warding removed from Electrum Tools, the focus should be on their Fortune properties
- Warding Shield nerfed from ✟ 2 -> ✟ 1 since warding now stacks

#### Adamant & DOOM!
- Adamant's intrinisc has been reworked into DOOM! (👥, CHECK WHO SUGGESTED THIS, AND EMAIL IF ITS OKAY TO CREDIT)
- Doom is an intrinic of adamant armour, which clears weakness every three seconds from nearby mobs, when the effect is cleared, it deals armour-piercing damage
- 𐕣 3 -> 1.5 hearts ; 𐕣 16 (Full set + Bonus) -> 8 hearts
    * These numbers will likley be changed when I get some more feedback
- Adamant's Weapon intrinic applies weakness to mobs
- Adamant's Tool intrinsic auto-smelts mined blocks
- Yes, this means using tipped weakness arrows is a really useful thing now, but I'll add a better recipe for that later (A way to get lingering potions I think)
- I think this fits Adamant's apocryphal title much more, and ties in with its hell-based theming

#### Design Decisions/Ethos Moving Forward
- Dolabras are shifting from being treated as an Axe (weapon), Axe (tool), and Pickaxe hyrbid to an Axe (tool) and Pickaxe hyrbid. So damage will go down for all of them, weapon-based enchants removed, and tool-based enchants improved
- A tier's armour, tool, and weapon intriniscs should be more varried and distinct. This will be the ethos going forward. (Look at Adamant for the best example of this)


### Bugs
#### Multiplayer Bugs
- 
#### General
- "Ophaned" villagers can only be children (💻, HapppySpud)
- Fortune now works on: Tomatoes, Glow berry vines, Chorus Plant (I think some of this was vanilla-intended, but I added it in regardless)

# Next Update

### Aspects
- Allows you to extract intrinsics from certain alloys, post-end enchanting
- Uses dragon's breath (rename to something?)
- Extracting an Aspect requires A withered Heart and a dragon's breath
- Bronze -> Eff
- Steel -> Unbreaking
- Electrum -> Fortune III
- Netherite -> Smelting
- Shakudo -> Silk Touch/Life Steal
- ??? -> Protection?? NOTHING...maybe, I just think it should be something only sweats get. But maybe as a replacement we can offer different protections. Ie. Undead protection, PVP protection, and just remove protection entirely

## Copper Intrinsic
- Lightning Rod/Conductive: redirects all "aura"-based nonsense to itsself, and nullifies it
- This may need to work differently on players, Ex. Zombies need only one piece to be immune, players may need more to nullify all damage

## Worldgen
- Make Diamonds more rare
- Add in Linkershim's dope ass portal things
- Polish-up villages
- Abbey, but better c:

## Low-Priority Bugs
- Add predicate for surface spawn that excludes structures
- When running on mud brick slabs with traversal boots, when I jump I get the speed boost, but when I just run on it normally I don't get the speed boost
- Villager Gift LT (Toolsmith give stone tools, laaame)


## Langs
"options.difficulty.peaceful.info"
"options.difficulty.easy.info"
"options.difficulty.normal.info"
"options.difficulty.hard.info"


### Advancements
- Restore their memory, of what they used to be (Echoes: Restore an Echo Shard's memory)
- Child of Moros: Smith Full Adamant Set 
- Harbinger of Fate: Smith Adamant Elytra 

# Stretch / Back-burner

## Small Additions
- Increase resin amount in pale graden fishing
- Potatoes and Molasses
- French Fries
- Jelly/Jam Bread (Or PBJ without the PB)
- Craftable Thorns
- Add Cinnabar and Sulfur, dripstone, raw copper to dripstone caves, Badlands raw gold, deep dark, disc fragments, to fishing trash
- Increase resin amount in pale graden fishing
- Add secondary items for certain villager trades (ie empty map for map trades)

### Suggestions
- Goat horns obtained from fishing always seem to be "Ponder". Can that be varied?
- Fermented Spider eye secret meal
- New paintings (with hints!)
- Bag of Sugar!
- ADV: Restore its memory, of what it used to be (Echoes: Restore an Echo Shard's memory)
- Shields
    - Steel shield: a normal shield but with high durability/unbreaking enchant attached
    - Shakudo shield: prevents you from splash potion effects being applied to you if held up (looking at witches), could also give a small amount of magic res as a bonus.
    - Hepatizon shield: removes movement speed penalty when held up.
    - Electrum shield: the same warding effects as current warding shield but blocking attacks from undead monsters deals damage to them so they will die even faster.
    - Adamantium shield: deals a very small dmg to the attacker when blocking his dmg, it works on all types of enemies but the damage is way lower than electrum shield, could also come with increased durability/unbreaking.
- Cold biomes (and oceans) should have better loot due to freezing water
- Rebalance obol to be more rare in chests? Trial chambers esp...idk

## Medium Additions
- "Have recipes or hints toward features appear in abandoned camp loot pools, or possibly other loot pools as well.
- Have spawners (aside from dungeons, wait no LT can't read entity data...)
    * I wanted to have a way for spawners to make mobs that won't drop anything, by spawning them with a tag
    * But I tag can't influence loot tables I dont think.

While much advamcement has been made toward making the learning process of the pack much more streamlined, encouraging players to explore in the hopes of learning more esoteric or even baseline batapack knowledge may be worthwhile. Little notes adding lore, or explaining mechanics; the diary of a chef going on about a recipe or a miner speaking about finding silver hugh up in the mountains."
- Cats traded by farmer?
- Wandering Trader trade more than just village maps


## Adv
- Get Full Health Advancement
- Craft a secret weapon advancemnt


## Textures
- All beds are gone :c
- Cactus Pot
- Azalea Pot
- Chest on boat texture n boat texture
- Change Ender chest to be Eye

## Misc
- Variant Villages to match with villager stories
- Knowledge books??
- Fishing Index (advancemnet only obtained by fisherman villager, with its own subtab with all the fish)
- Sherds for Enchants?? From Archaeologist
- Maps from Archaeologist based on books (I think Paradise Lost going to Abbey makes sense)
- Upgraded horns for different mobs
- Armour Trim fix-up
- Polish-up abbey, more surrounding buildings, proper downstairs entrance.
    - Actually I think full redesign, manage spawners better. More buildings, more uses for the Copper Eye
- Polish up papal outpost, give barrel a LT
- Quartz ore gen, sulfur ore gen, make sulurfous quartz something else?
### Ore Gen
- Coal high in swamps
- Sulfur high in sulfur caves
- Iron high in Cold Biomes


## Wither Rework
- An attack that makes you loose a crystal heart
